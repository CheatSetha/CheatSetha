# 😂 Fake Pentester Profile

> *“I hack therefore I am… hungry.”* 🍕💻

Hi, I’m **[Alias the Bugslayer]** — a junior pentester for fun, chaos, and memes. Not a professional (yet), but I break test machines and collect screenshots like Pokémon.

## 👾 About me

* 🧑‍💻 Title: Self‑proclaimed Junior Pentester in Training
* ☕ Superpower: Converts coffee into `nmap` scans
* 🐧 Favorite OS: The one that boots without errors
* 😹 Motto: "Try Harder… then try memes"

---

## 🔧 My Fake Arsenal

* `nmap` — because knocking politely never works
* `ffuf` — throwing random words at servers since forever
* `Burp Suite` — my glorified snack sniffer
* `Metasploit` — push button → receive shell
* `python` — scripting my way into confusion

---

## 📚 What I’m *pretending* to learn

* Active Directory: aka digital family drama
* Privilege Escalation: climbing the ladder, one exploit at a time
* Web fuzzing: basically yelling at websites until they talk back

---

## 🎯 Meme Projects

* **404notfound-labs** — collection of scripts that don’t work but look cool
* **flag-chaser** — my personal CTF writeups, 80% memes, 20% solutions
* **pentest-memes** — a repo where code meets comedy

---

## 🏆 Totally Real Achievements

* 🥇 Won a CTF where the flag was literally `flag{123}`
* ☠️ Rooted my own laptop accidentally (twice)
* 🐱 Discovered my cat’s default password was `meowmeow`
