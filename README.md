# 😂 Fake Junior Pentester Profile

> *“I hack therefore I am… hungry.”* 🍕💻

Hi, I’m **[Alias the Bugslayer]** — a **fake junior pentester** for laughs, chaos, and memes. Not a professional (yet), but I break test machines and collect screenshots like Pokémon.

## 🔧 My Fake Arsenal

* `nmap` — because knocking politely never works
* `ffuf` — throwing random words at servers since forever
* `Burp Suite` — my glorified snack sniffer
* `Metasploit` — push button → receive shell
* `python` — scripting my way into confusion
* `feroxbuster` — aka Ctrl+C generator

## 📚 What I’m *pretending* to learn

* Active Directory: aka digital family drama
* Privilege Escalation: climbing the ladder, one exploit at a time
* Web fuzzing: basically yelling at websites until they talk back
* Report writing: the **final boss** of pentesting

## 🎯 Meme Projects

* **404notfound-labs** — collection of scripts that don’t work but look cool
* **flag-chaser** — my personal CTF writeups, 80% memes, 20% solutions
* **pentest-memes** — a repo where code meets comedy
* **coffee-overflow** — every script runs until I run out of caffeine

## 🏆 Totally Fake Achievements

* ☠️ Rooted my own laptop accidentally (twice)
* 🐱 Discovered my cat’s default password was `meowmeow`

**Me explaining to friends what a buffer overflow is:**

```
Friend: “So it’s like overfilling a glass of water?”
Me: “YES, but the glass is RAM and the water is machine code.”
```

**Pentester starter pack IRL:**

```
💻 Laptop
☕ Coffee
😴 Sleep deprivation
📂 12 wordlists named 'final'
```

**After fuzzing for 8 hours and the flag was just /hidden/flag.php:**
